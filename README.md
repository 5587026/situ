# Situ 1.0

The Situ [constructed language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) uses logic and [semantic primes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_primes) to clearly and precisely articulate concepts. 
Situ uses formal logic to structure sentences.

Situ does not use verbs, but rather expresses relationships between the noun phrases making up the sentence by a *relational*, which defines the relationship between arguments. Situ is postpositional and SRO, where 'r' is a relational.

Situ is currently under construction.
