# Situ 1.0

The Situ [constructed language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) uses logic and semantic primes to clearly and precisely articulate concepts. 
Situ uses formal logic to structure sentences.

Situ does not use verbs, but rather expresses relationships between the noun phrases making up the sentence by a *relational*, which defines the relationship between arguments.
