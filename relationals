The relational system of Situ shows the relations between the arguments of a sentence. 
These function in almost the same way as verbs, except that they show the relationship between arguments.

There are eight relationals, all postpositional:
 * []: used to show one argument affecting another
 * []: used to show one argument using another
 * []: used to show one argument being in a state or location of another
 * []: used to show one argument
